This document explains how to use the C++ program "Sort." There are three
	main components to the program:

1) The main file (sort.cpp) that contains the written code to parse the command line 
	and conduct the different types of sorts.

2) The class files for each type of sort which contain methods and members to
	conduct each respective sort.

3) The makefile that compiles the code together, whereupon the executable can be
	launched with the following options.

	sort --help | [ -i | -m | -h | -q | -c | -r | -b ] [-v | --verbose] [ [-n num | --size num] | [--list file] ]  

	-i: insert sort
	-m: merge sort
	-h: heap sort
	-q: quicksort
	-c: counting sort
	-r: radix sort
	-b: bucket sort
	-v or --verbose: prints the final, sorted array
        -n or --size: takes in a number where num > 0 and creates a vector with the same number of elements
		where each element is a randomly generated number
	--list: opens the file specified and places the numbers therein into a vector. In the file, numbers must
 		be greater than or equal to zero, and separated by spaces.

To compile the sort program, type "make sort" into the command line, and hit enter.

To start the program, type "./sort," the sort flag you wish to use, and the method of vector
	population that you prefer. One of the following arguments must be provided, or the executable 
	will not run:

	1) To generate a randomized vector, type "--size" or "-n" followed by an unsigned number
	2) To generate a specific set of numbers, place a list of white-space-separated numbers into a text file
		and type "--list" followed by the filename.

The flag "-v" and "--verbose" are optional, and do not affect the conduct of the executable other than allowing
	it to print the sorted vector to stdout.

To remove all object files and the executable, type "make clean" in the command line.
